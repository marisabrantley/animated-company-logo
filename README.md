# Animated Company Logo Project

The Logo Factory has a new Sass logo and they'd like it to be animated.

## Objective
* Using SCSS, make the text slide in from the left and make the opacity of the circle change as it appears behind the letters.
* Clean up with SCSS provided, determining when to use mixins, extend a placeholder, as well as splitting up the logic into partials.
